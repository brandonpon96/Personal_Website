					<h2>About me</h2>
					<p>Hello there!  My name is Brandon, and I am a second-year computer science student attending UCLA.  I'm always on the lookout for neat software and programming opportunities to gain more experience on real life large (or small) scale applications. I prefer to focus on Android and iOS mobile platforms, with a growing interest in mobile networking applications.</p>

					<h2>Some Stuff I Do</h2>

						<h3>EcoWatch</h3>
						<p>Environmental issues are always a concern.

With our application, you can contribute to raising awareness of any environment issue by just taking a picture of what you see, be it a major litter area, oil spillage, heavy smog, or anything else. Along with the picture, your location will also be added to compiled data eco-map, where you can view where people are seeing environmental concerns around the world.

Our theory is that the more serious the issue is, the more pictures people will take of it. By locating areas on the eco-map with a high concentration of pictures, we can more easily identify which places require the most attention.</p>

						<h3>SnapRoulette</h3>
						<p>So, you know Snapchat & Chatroulette? SnapRoulette is those 2 combined!

						SnapRoulette allows you to snap pics and send them off to completely random people! At the same time, you will be able to view completely random pics that other people have posted.

						Use at your own risk.

						Any brave souls who are willing to take a chance at random pictures or want to share somethings with others. You could get a picture that is horrifying, funny, interesting, thought provoking, anything!</p>
